Creating your own Execution Environment for Ansible Automation Platform

If you need specific ansible collections or applications available in your execution environment then you can use ansible-builder to create these custom containers.

This example creates an execution environment where the mssql collection from galaxy is added and Microsoft Powershell is added through a rpm.
